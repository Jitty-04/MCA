      A keylogger is an insidious form of spyware. You enter sensitive data onto your keyboard, believing nobody is watching. In fact, keylogging software is hard at work logging everything that you type.

      Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit – all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals wait to make use of all this sensitive information.
      
      If keyloggers seem like Hollywood fiction, that’s because we’ve seen them on the silver screen before. You might remember Tom Cruise’s character using one a Mission Impossible film, and the popular hacker show Mr. Robot bases a key plot point around keyloggers.
      
      These cybercriminals aren’t just eavesdropping on whatever you are typing. They have ringside seats.
      <h1 style="color:black"><B>Two Types Of Keylogger</B></h1>


 <p style="color:black;"><B>Some keyloggers are hardware devices embedded within your internal PC hardware. They also come as a form of a plug placed between the CPU box and keyboard cable in an inconspicuous manner. In either case, someone will have to physically plant the hardware into your PC or its peripherals. This will require a  degree of secrecy if it needs to be achieved clandestinely.

  The second type of keyloggers are software that can be easily installed on victims’ devices. While this software is a type of malware, it is “good” malware, wherein it doesn’t harm its host. Its sole job is to snoop into the keystrokes and not impact the computer. You merrily go about your business, while undetectable keyloggers start stealing personal or sensitive data, without you ever knowing.

<h1 style="color:black"><B>Here are a few tips for keylogger removal to avoid getting sucked into the “maelstrom” of cyberattacks:</B></h1>


 <p style="color:black;"><B>If you think your computer is a target for  keyloggers, keep checking for unwanted software, and delete it
  <br>Don’t download files from unknown sources
  <br>While entering password info on banking sites, use a virtual keyboard; in fact, use a virtual keyboard wherever possible
  <br>Use a password manager, as the manager will automatically enter the password, making keystrokes redundant (no keystroke, no keystroke logging)
  <br>Use a powerful and next-gen antivirus and internet security suite that can keep your personal computer safe from advanced and evolved cyberattacks and identify and remove malicious software for you
